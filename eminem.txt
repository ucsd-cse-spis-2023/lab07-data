Yeah I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now But hey, what daddy always tell you? Straighten up little soldier Stiffen up that upper lip What you crying about? You got me. Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad When I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry 'Cause you're scared, I ain't there? Daddy's with you in your prayers No more crying, wipe them tears Daddy's here, no more nightmares We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it Lainie Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you girl and you better know it We're all we got in this world When it spins, when it swirls When it whirls, when it twirls Two little beautiful girls Lookin' puzzled, in a daze I know it's confusing you Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me All the things growing up as daddy, that he had to see Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me But things have got so bad between us I don't see us ever being together ever again Like we used to be when we was teenagers But then of course everything always happens for a reason I guess it was never meant to be But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream Now hush little baby, don't you cry Everything's gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why We fear how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby But I promise mama's gon' be alright (Ha) It's funny I remember back one year when daddy had no money Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me 'Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying 'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom And at the time every house that we lived in Either kept getting broken into and robbed Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college Almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it And I know it hurts so bad it broke your mamma's heart And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre And flew you and momma out to see me But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it And you and Lainnie were too young to understand it Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand 'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud Now I'm sitting in this empty house, just reminiscing Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now Wow, I guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here Lainnie I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here I like the sound of that, yeah It's got a ring to it don't it? Shh, mama's only gone for the moment Now hush little baby, don't you cry Everything's gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why We fear how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby But I promise mama's gon' be alright And if you ask me to Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird I'mma give you the world I'mma buy a diamond ring for you I'mma sing for you I'll do anything for you to see you smile And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine I'mma break that birdie's neck I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad (ha ha)
Yeah, it's my life My own words, I guess Have you ever loved someone so much You'd give an arm for Not the expression, no Literally give an arm for When they know they're your heart And you know you are their armor And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her But what happens when karma Turns right around and bites you And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you What happens when you become the main source of her pain "Daddy look what I made" "Dad's gotta go catch a plane" "Daddy where's mommy? I can't find mommy, where is she?" "I don't know, go play, Hailie baby, your daddy's busy Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gon' write itself" I give you one underdog, and you gotta swing by yourself Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her And put hands on her mother who's the spittin' image of her That's Slim Shady, yeah baby Slim Shady's crazy Shady made me But tonight, Shady's rock-a-bye baby And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin' And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin' And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back I keep havin' this dream I'm pushin' Hailie on a swing, she keeps screamin', she don't want me to sing "You're makin' mommy cry, why, why is mommy cryin'" "Baby, daddy ain't leavin' no more, daddy you're lyin' You always say that, you always say this is the last time But you ain't leavin' no more daddy, you're mine" She's pilin' boxes in front of the door tryin' to block it "Daddy please, daddy, don't leave, daddy, no, stop it" Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket It's got a picture, "This will keep you safe daddy, take it with ya" I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror These fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man I can hear 'em They're sayin', "you got one more chance to do right And it's tonight, now go out and show 'em that you love 'em before it's too late" And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door It turns to a stage, they're gone and the spotlight is on and I'm singin' And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin' And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin' And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back Sixty thousand people all jumpin' out their seat The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet I take a bow, and thank you all for comin' out They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein' "Daddy, its me, help mommy, her wrists are bleedin'" But baby we're in Sweden How did you get to Sweden? "I followed you daddy You told me that you weren't leavin' You lied to me dad, and now you made mommy sad And I bought you this coin, it says number one dad That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin" "I get the point, fine, me and mommy are goin'" "But baby wait, it's too late dad, you made your choice Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us That's what they want They want you, Marshall They keep screamin' your name It's no wonder you can't go to sleep Just take another pill, yeah I bet you you will! You rap about it, yeah word, kid keep it real" I hear a applause, all this time I couldn't see How could it be, that the curtain is closin' on me I turn around, find a gun on the ground Cock it, put it to my brain, scream "die Shady!" And pop it The sky darkens, my life flashes The plane that I was supposed to be on, crashes, and burns to ashes That's when I wake up Alarm clock's ringing, there's birds singin' It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin' I walk right up to Kim and kiss her tell her I miss her Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister almost as if to say And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin' And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin' And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed Get along with the voices inside of my head You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey Wanted to receive attention for my music Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways Fame made me a balloon ‘cause my ego inflated When I blew, see, but it was confusing ‘Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam Ooh!
