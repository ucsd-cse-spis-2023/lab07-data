Waking up, midnight November And you're still in my bed It's kinda rough, 'cause since I met ya There's things we've never said So if I go for a little while longer When I'm home we can talk about the pitfalls of the road If you say go I would stop everything, oh My heart would play the role now And act like it's never been broke Though my soul Oh, oh, oh Lately I really need to know How long, how long, can we be touch-and-go? Oh my soul, oh, oh, oh How long, how long, can we be touch-and-go? It's not enough, to say I want ya 'Cause I'll say anything I'm holding out, to feel without a doubt I have just been questioning, yeah If I go for a little while longer When I'm home we can talk about the pitfalls of the road If you say go, I would stop everything oh My heart would play the role And act like it's never been broke Though my soul Oh, oh, oh Lately I really need to know How long, how long, can we be touch-and-go? Oh my soul, oh oh oh How long, how long, can we be? All of my bones, they scream I'm right If you're taking me home to stay the night Darling my soul would heal If you say go I would stop everything, oh My heart would play the role And act like it's never been broke Though my soul, oh, oh, oh Lately I really need to know How long, how long, can we be touch and go Oh my soul, oh, oh, oh How long, how long, can we be touch-and-go? How long, how long, can we be touch-and-go? How long, how long, can we be touch-and-go?

Oh, misty eye of the mountain below Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke Keep watching over Durin's son If this is to end in fire Then we should all burn together Watch the flames climb high into the night Calling out for the rope, sent by and we will Watch the flames burn on and on the mountain side hey And if we should die tonight Then we should all die together Raise a glass of wine for the last time Calling out for the rope Prepare as we will Watch the flames burn on and on the mountain side Desolation comes upon the sky Now I see fire, inside the mountain I see fire, burning the trees And I see fire, hollowing souls And I see fire, blood in the breeze And I hope that you'll remember me Oh, should my people fall Then surely I'll do the same Confined in mountain halls We got too close to the flame Calling out father hold fast and we will Watch the flames burn on and on the mountain side Desolation comes upon the sky Now I see fire, inside the mountain I see fire, burning the trees And I see fire, hollowing souls And I see fire, blood in the breeze And I hope that you'll remember me And if the night is burning I will cover my eyes For if the dark returns then My brothers will die And as the sky's falling down It crashed into this lonely town And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out Now I see fire, inside the mountain I see fire, burning the trees And I see fire, hollowing souls And I see fire, blood in the breeze I see fire, oh you know I saw a city burning (fire) And I see fire, feel the heat upon my skin (fire) And I see fire (fire) And I see fire (burn on and on and mountains side)
