We were both young when I first saw you I close my eyes and the flashback starts I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns See you make your way through the crowd And say hello Little did I know That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet" And I was crying on the staircase Begging you, please, don't go And I said, "Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone I'll be waiting, all that's left to do is run You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess It's a love story, baby just say yes So I sneak out to the garden to see you We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew So close your eyes, escape this town for a little while 'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter And my daddy said "Stay away from Juliet" But you were everything to me, I was begging you, please, don't go And I said Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess It's a love story baby just say yes Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel This love is difficult, but it's real Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess It's a love story, baby just say "Yes" Oh, oh I got tired of waiting Wondering if you were ever coming around My faith in you was fading When I met you on the outskirts of town And I said "Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone I keep waiting for you but you never come Is this in my head? I don't know what to think" He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said "Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone I love you and that's all I really know I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress It's a love story, baby just say yes" Oh, oh, Oh, oh 'Cause we were both young when I first saw you.
