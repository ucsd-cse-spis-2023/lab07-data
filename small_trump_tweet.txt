Morning Joe's weakness is its low ratings. I don't watch anymore but I heard he went wild against Rudy Giuliani and #2A - sad &amp; irrelevant!.@dbongino  You were fantastic in defending both the Second Amendment and me last night on @CNN.

https://t.co/oHI6xrDJU0So with all of the Obama tough talk on Russia and the Ukraine, they have already taken Crimea and continue to push. That's what I said!When I said in an interview that Putin is "not going into Ukraine, you can mark it down," I am saying if I am President. Already in Crimea!This story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart!Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same - Nice!Wow, it is unbelievable how distorted, one-sided and biased the media is against us. The failing @nytimes is a joke. @CNN is laughable!"@RealJamesWoods:  Without absolutely OWNING the liberal media, HillaryClinton wouldn't stand a chance. #VoterFraud and #MSM her only hope."The dishonest media is fawning over the Democratic Convention. I wonder why, then, my speech had millions of more viewers than Crooked H?I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me!Captain Khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero, but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our "leaders" to eradicate it!Nielson Media Research final numbers on ACCEPTANCE SPEECH: TRUMP  32.2 MILLION.  CLINTON 27.8 MILLION.  Thank you!Thank you to all of the television viewers that made my speech at the Republican National Convention #1 over Crooked Hillary and DEMS.Can you imagine if I had the small crowds that Hillary is drawing today in Pennsylvania. It would be a major media event! @CNN @FoxNewsNATO commander agrees members should pay up via @dcexaminer:
https://t.co/VZLDFy707KWow, NATO's top commander just announced that he agrees with me that alliance members must PAY THEIR BILLS. This is a general I will like!The "Rust Belt" was created by politicians like the Clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like Mexico. END!Crooked's stop in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians, drew less than 200 - with Bill, VP#CrookedHillary = Obama's third term, which would be terrible news for our economic growth - seen below. https://t.co/y9WJoUaaqlWord is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA?I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better!Why doesn't the media want to report that on the two "Big Thursdays" when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches - Republican's won ratings#CrookedHillary https://t.co/xyoPFJmBypCrooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime, supports open borders, and wants massive tax hikes. A formula for disaster!Violent crime is rising across the United States, yet the DNC convention ignored it. Crime reduction will be one of my top priorities.Just got back from Colorado.

His last term as Mayor was a disaster!General John Allen, who I never met but spoke against me last night, failed badly in his fight against ISIS.

People want LAW AND ORDER!Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me, and "forgot" to mention the many problems of our country, in her very average scream!The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke. @CNN and the little watched @Morning_Joe = SAD!No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes.Hillary's wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction, terrorism and ISIS across the world.Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety.Hillary will never reform Wall Street. She is owned by Wall Street!Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.Hillary's refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.Departing now - thank you Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

PatheticOur not very bright Vice President, Joe Biden, just stated that I wanted to "carpet bomb" the enemy. Sorry Joe, that was Ted Cruz!Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO!Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough!The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD!Funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said "Trump is a genius." America 1st!As I have been saying, Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv.Just like I have warned from the beginning, Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP.
